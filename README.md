The following game is played by two players.

Consider a game board consisting of 5 rows and 4 columns. The game is played with 4 blue stones and 4 red stones. Initially, the stones are arranged on the board as follows:

+---+---+---+---+
| B | R | B | R |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+
| R | B | R | B |
+---+---+---+---+

Players move in turn, the first player plays with the red stones, the other with the blue stones. In a move, a player must move one of his or her stones by one square to an empty square, either horizontally or vertically. The winner is the player who first forms an unbroken chain of three stones of his or her color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

When the game is started, the program must ask for the names of the players.

The program must store the result of the games as follows. For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started, the name of the players, the number of turns made by the players during the game, and the name of the winner. The program should be able to display a high score table in which the top 5 players with the most wins are displayed.

The game must store data in a database, in a JSON file, or in an XML document.
